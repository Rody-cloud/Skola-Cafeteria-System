// Generate a random email to avoid collision
const randomId = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000);
const email = `testuser${randomId}@stu.topkapi.edu.tr`;
// Need to add this email to allowed list first or pick one that bypasses? 
// Actually, the system requires the email to be in AllowedEmail table.
// This might be tricky if I don't know a valid allowed email that isn't taken.
// Alternatively, I can check the code to see if there's a bypass or just trust the restart theory.

// Let's look at seed_allowed_emails.js to find a valid email pattern or see if I can insert one.
// Better yet, just explain the restart usage since I know `node server.js` doesn't reload.
